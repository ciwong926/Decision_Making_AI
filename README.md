1. Make sure you have Processing Software downloaded on your computer.

2. Click on the folder of the program you wish to run.

3. Click on the pde file inside the folder. If you have Processing on your computer code a window with code should appear. 

4. Note that I coded this with the Java version of Processing. In the top right hand corner of the window where a language is selected, make sure that it says "Java". If not select Java from the drop down.

5. Running decisions_ciwong.pde: If you wish to run it click on the run button at the top left hand of the window.
